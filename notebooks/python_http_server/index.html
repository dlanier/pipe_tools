This site is an exhibition of interesting images defined and produced computationally. 
Image computation proceeds from an equation that defines how to express <u>any</u> pixel based on its starting location on the complex plane. 
</big>
<br/><br/>
<big>
The Julia and Mandelbrot Sets were the inspiration for these pixel equations. They aren't necessarily models of anything in the real world. They are chosen for aesthetic value after searching some small part of equation space.
</big>
<br/><br/>

<a href="eqFinger.html">Equations Directory</a> is an image catalog of equations with parameters & placement chosen to produce graphical pixel grids as an informal art form; they are this artist's virtual self expression, mathematically defined form, that might be reproduced in any colors at extremely large or small scale.
<br/><br/>
Images currently on the site were shown as prints at Monica's By the Park (San Diego, CA winter 2009) or Inigo Gallery (Champaign, IL summer of 2012).
<br/><br/>
<big><i>Note that since they are mathematically generated they mainly exist the mind.</i></big>
